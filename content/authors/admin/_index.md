I am a Statistician and Mathematical Modeller Research Fellow in the Department of Statistics, [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/).

I have a number of years experience working on a wide range of projects across government and academia in defence and health.

I studied mathematics and statistics at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and obtained a PhD in applied probability from the University of Liverpool. After working for the [Ministry of Defence](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory) for several years, applying novel Bayesian Inference ideas, I moved back into academia and the field of public health in 2010.
